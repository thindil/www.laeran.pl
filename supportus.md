-- title: Support Us
By "us" I mean me and my page :) Contrary to popular beliefs, support can be
done in a few ways:

* User contribution: Just use any of services available on the page or download
  and use my Open Sources programs. Yes, it is a contribution too. And if you
  are more ambitious, you can [contact](contact.html) with me and say it :) Be
  aware that your work is useful for someone it is also motivating thing.
  Motivation = support :)

* Quality and Assurance contribution: If you found any bug (typos and grammar
  mistakes are also bugs) on page or in my programs, please report them. Again,
  same as with user contribution, at least I will know if someone uses it. Plus
  this will help other people too, especially when I finally fix these most
  obvious problems. If you want to report here, you even don't need an account to
  open ticker or start talking on the forums. Just, thanks to the spammers, all
  new entries from new accounts need to be reviewed before they will be visible
  to everyone.

* Marketing contribution: Spread the word about the page, its services and
  about available Open Source packages here. The more people will know about
  this place, the more support we will have :) Tell your friends about the
  page, put links to it on various social media pages, etc.

* Financial contribution: Well, I'm daydreaming about someday quit my job and
  start work as a full-time Open Source developer. Maybe someday it happens,
  but for this I will need a lot of help from other peoples. Thus, if you have
  any spare "coins" I been very happy to take them :) Of course, before we can
  talk in something in exchange, some examples:

  * I could focus my work on Open Source projects on which you select and do
    what you want. Simply: hire me to do some Open Source work. Here are no
    strict prices, everything have to be discussed separately.

  * I can mention you on the page as a sponsor. Or you can just buy
    advertisement space here. Same as with hiring, no constant prices, let's
    discuss your and my expectations.

  * If you think that my work is worth something, just donate me. If you
    selected [LiberaPay](https://liberapay.com/thindil/) option, you will be
    able even to give something completely anonymously. In [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/laeran)
    option, everything is open and visible to everyone. Even when and how
    much money I take :)
