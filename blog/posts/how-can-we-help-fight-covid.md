The blog entry should probably appear around one year earlier. But it is better
to be later than never. :) Anyway, back to the topic.

## General information

Probably the most of us have enough the pandemic. Not only due to lockdowns but
also, because we are bombarded with information about it in every place. Even
here. :) And that situation can take some more time. One of the most obvious
answers on the question in title of the post is to obey medical
recommendations. But we can do even more to ends the pandemic faster.

One of the biggest problems with the current situation is lack of the
information about the virus. We meet something completely new, and we just
started to collecting data about it. Of course, the most of us don't have
enough medical education to join the efforts, but we have something other what
can help scientists better understand the problem: our computers and
smartphones.

The most research today require a lot of computer power to analyze, very often
gigantic amount of collected data. And probably in every country in the world,
research require much more computer power than it have available. Fortunately,
here exist a few projects which can help both sides: the scientists who need to
analyze data and people who want to help with research. These projects allow
share unused resources of volunteers' computers to work on the selected
scientific projects. Something like this is called *volunteer computing*. The
general idea is that volunteers download a special program which allow them to
connect to servers owned by scientists, download a small part of data and
analyze it on the local computer. After work, a computer again communicate
with a server by sending it a result of work. More detailed and better
explained information about that idea, you can find at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteer_computing)

Below I will present a few of that projects. But before you start anything,
please remember. When any of these projects works on your computer it may
work a lot slower. Thus, the best option is to use them only when you are not
using directly your computer. Additionally, because your computer may work
with bigger load than usual, unfortunately, your electrical bills can be a bit
higher too. At least now, during the winter, you will have additional, small
source of heat around self :) But don't worry, these programs if used with
default settings or lower, they will not damage your computer in any way.

### Folding@Home

[Website](https://foldingathome.org/home/)

**Folding@home** is the volunteer computing project created at *Washington
University in St. Louis*. Its main goal is to help scientists develop new
therapeutics for a variety of diseases by the means of simulating protein
dynamics. Or in a bit more simple way: the project is looking for various
medicines for treatment many diseases. Since start the pandemic, the main goal
of the project is to help understand how virus works and affects our bodies. At
this moment, it is one of the fastest computing systems on the world.

You can join the project by go to its [Start Folding](https://foldingathome.org/start-folding/)
page and download the proper client for your operating system. The project
doesn't require registration. It is completely optional. Thus, after
downloading you can start the program and begin to contribute to various
research projects. The default settings should be good for the most of the
people. But, if you will need any help with it, please look at [FAQ](https://foldingathome.org/support/faq/),
there you can find also detailed information about the program installation
and running.

**Folding@Home** is the proprietary software, even if build on a top of Open
Source various libraries and programs.

### BOINC

[Website](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/)

**BOINC** is short for *Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing*. It is
also volunteer computing project but created at *University of California,
Berkeley*. It started as the support for the project *SETI@home*, but growth over
time to support any type of research projects. By the most time, **BOINC** has
opinion of a program directed to the more advanced computer users. In last few
years it slowly started changing, but it is still more complicated to start and
using it than **Folding@Home**. I will describe here a simpler way to join the
project. Later, if you want, you can read the project documentation how to set
it for your needs.

The easiest way to join is to use special *Account Manager* page called
[Science United](https://scienceunited.org/).
1. In this project registration is required, thus please create an account
   there.
2. After account creation, you will be redirected to the [download page](https://scienceunited.org/download.php)
   where you can download the program for your operating system.
3. Next, when you start the program, you will need to connect the computer
   to your Science United account. How to do it, is described on [next after download page](https://scienceunited.org/download.php?action=installed).
4. The final step is to select the type of science to which you want to
   contribute. If you want to help fight COVID-19 you should select *Biology
   and Medicine* -> *Disease research* -> *COVID-19 and virology*.
5. Now you can start the program and begin to contribute to various research
   projects.

As you see, the whole set up process is much more complicated than in
**Folding@Home**. We even not described the process to configure the program, but
default configuration should be good for the most people too. More
documentation about the project you can find at [its page](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/).

BOINC is the Open Source software, not only the client but the server either.

### Notes

* It is recommended to run these programs on graphic card (GPU). They have a
  lot more computation power than standard processors (CPU) thus can do a lot
  more research. But in that situation your computer will be almost unusable.
  While there is no problem with priorities for these programs when they use
  processor, running them on graphic card cause that even mouse will start
  lagging on the screen, until the programs will not be paused or stopped.
* Before run any of these programs, please read a bit the documentation for
  them.
* Some computations can take a very long time (even days) when others only a
  few minutes. It depends not only on your hardware but also on the selected
  research project.

## Mobile

### DreamLab

[Website](https://www.vodafone.com.au/foundation/dreamlab)

**DreamLab** is application for Android and iOS created by *Vodafone Australia
Foundation* and *Imperial College London*. It was designed to help scientists
research cancer and COVID-19. The application works only when a smartphone is
charged. It is even impossible to start it on battery. **DreamLab** same as the
desktop projects, connects to the server, takes some data to compute and run
them on the smartphone. From all these three projects, this one is probably
easiest to use. It is also the youngest from all projects.

To start computing, just download application from the proper store, install it
and run when the smartphone is charged. Select from the list on which project
you want to work, and start the application. **DreamLab** will stop working if
temperature of your phone battery reach higher level (around 40-50 Celsius
degrees), thus it shouldn't cause any problems for the smartphone.

**DreamLab** is the proprietary software.

## Final words

As you see, here are a lot of ways to join efforts in fight with the pandemic.
Any help, even the smallest count, and can speed up the end of problems.
There are some results from these projects are used in medical research or
treatment.

Of course, one short blog entry can't give all needed information to everyone.
If someone will be more interested in this topic, feel free to [contact with me](../../contact.html).

Come, join us, especially that all of these things don't require too much
attention after setting up.
