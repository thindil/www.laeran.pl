-- title: General information about the Ada Programming Language Matrix room
-- summary: What is Matrix?
-- details: <p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(protocol)">Wikipedia</a>: Matrix is an open standard and lightweight protocol for real-time communication. It is designed to allow users with accounts at a communication service provider to communicate with users of a different service provider via online chat, Voice over IP, and Videotelephony. That is, it aims to make real-time communication work seamlessly between different service providers, just like standard Simple Mail Transfer Protocol email does now for store-and-forward email service.</p><p>From a technical perspective, it is an application layer communication protocol for federated real-time communication. It provides HTTP APIs and open source reference implementations for securely distributing and persisting messages in JSON format over an open federation of servers. It can integrate with standard web services via WebRTC, facilitating browser-to-browser applications.</p>
