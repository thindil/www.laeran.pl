This document was added to the website in Mar 2019 in order to assure compliance with the [General Data Protection Regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation); a regulation in the European Union on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA).

The website [https://www.laeran.pl/](https://www.laeran.pl/) is hosted in Poland and subject to this regulation.

## Who we are

My name is Bartek Jasicki (nickname `thindil`) and I own the website published at the address [https://www.laeran.pl/](https://www.laeran.pl/). Therefore, I'm the only responsible for managing your data collected on the mentioned website (except about "embedded content from other websites", see below).

## What personal data we collect, why we collect it, and how long we retain it

### Ada Planet (FreshRSS)

Entering RSS aggregator cause creating on your computer cookie file called `FreshRSS` with your session identifier. It will be deleted when you left the page and create new when you back. There no other data collected on this page.

### Ada Search (Google Custom Search engine)

This page is mostly embedded Google Custom Search engine thus it uses [Google Privacy and Terms](https://policies.google.com/privacy) rules. I don't add any cookies or tracking scripts there.

### Blog

The blog doesn't create any cookies or store any data on your computer, it is the set of static webpages.

### Embedded content from other websites

Texts on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website. These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website. (e.g. Embedding a Youtube video player).

### Analytics

I don't use analytic services, so I can't share the visitor statistics with anyone (I don't use Google Analytics or other scripts to track you). I don't do any automated decision-making and/or profiling on the user data.

### How I protect your data

The data and the files can be accessed only via SSH with code access of the server. I am the only person with this access right now. It is not possible to access this folder via public access.

### What data breach/moderation procedures we have in place

If I notice any breach to the server I promise to inform you immediately at least on the main page.
